# X3L ToolBar / Video Game Modding Toolkit (VGMT?)
This program is a Multi-game modding toolkit, a various assortment of tools that you can use to mod some popular games.
This has been my first ever project working in C# and it was mostly done so for my own personal use, hoping that somebody out there can find some usefulness in this.
This program is far from complete and I'm working on it at very erratic intervals, if you'd like to help me out by giving suggestions or building on what I've got lay out; it's most appreciated. :)
